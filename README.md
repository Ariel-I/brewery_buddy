<h2> Description <h2>

<h3> Welcome to Brewery Buddy! This is an online app intended for users to save their favorite breweries as well as some notes about their experience or their favorites beers. The app was built using Sinatra and utilizes MVC's and CRUD commands. All the use needs to do is sign up through the site with an email and password and they will be presented with their homepage of saved breweries!</h3> 

<h2> Getting started </h2>

-- You can find the Solabee Plants CLI in the github repository git@github.com:Ariel-I/brewery_buddy.git --

In order to properly run the program you must clone the github repository from the link provided above. After cloning the repo be sure your terminal is in the right file by typing 'cd brewery_buddy' and hitting enter. 

Then run - bundle install - in order to access all of the necessary gems.

After the gems are installed you can run the program by running - shotgun - in the terminal and follow the route to the local host provided. 
<h2> How to </h2>

New users will have to sign up in order to create a new account. After creating a new login the user will be directed to the index page where there breweries will be stored. The page will start out blank and the user has the option to add a brewery or logout. After creating some breweries the user will have the option to view, edit or delete the brewery. The best part is where the user can save notes about the beers they liked the most!

Cheers!
